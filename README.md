# telecom-provider

In the exercise we pretend that we are working for a telecom provider.
The provider needs a new API with initially just three endpoints.

We would like you to spec out those endpoints and provide sample implementations for those API endpoints.
In our (imaginary) database, we are starting to store phone numbers associated to customers (​1 customer : N phone numbers​) and we will provide an API to modify them.

We need 3 APIs:
  ● get all phone numbers
  ● get all phone numbers of a single customer
  ● activate a phone number
